# PFAC-SQLINJECTOR

A high-performance SQL injection detection tool using parallel pattern matching algorithms on CUDA.

## Overview

PFAC-SQLINJECTOR utilizes the Parallel Failure-less Aho-Corasick (PFAC) algorithm implemented on NVIDIA CUDA to efficiently detect potential SQL injection patterns in large query datasets. The project employs GPU acceleration to significantly improve the processing speed of query validation compared to traditional CPU-based methods.

## Requirements

- NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (12.0 or newer recommended)
- NVIDIA GPU with Compute Capability 3.5 or higher
- C++ compiler with C++11 support

## Cuda Implementation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PFAC-SQLINJECTOR.git
cd PFAC-SQLINJECTOR

# Compile with NVCC (NVIDIA CUDA Compiler)
nvcc -o Aho-Corasick Aho-Corasick.cu

nvcc -o PFAC PFAC.cu
```

## Project Structure


## SQL Injection Pattern Categories


## Risk Classification System

- **Low Risk (â‰¤30)**: Potential SQL keywords detected but likely benign
- **Medium Risk (31-70)**: Multiple SQL patterns detected that might indicate an attack
- **High Risk (71-90)**: Clear evidence of SQL manipulation attempts
- **Critical Risk (>90)**: Destructive operations or command execution attempts detected
